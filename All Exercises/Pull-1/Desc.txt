1-Start in a hanging pull-up position.
2-As you begin the pull-up, accelerate your body so you get some momentum.
3-At the top of the pull-up, keep the momentum going and as your head and shoulders pass the bar.
4-As your body starts to return to the ground and control your descent back to a hanging position.
Now for the level- up question: “I can only do a few pull-ups, how do I get better?”
This is a challenging movement and will take some practice.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Many people will have a hard time during this phase of the muscle-up progression at first.
It takes a lot of control but mastering this piece will bring everything together. 
1-After your dip, you will keep your thumbs tucked nice and close to your chest. 
2-Start to slowly let your body slide back and out of that dip position. 
3-As you do so the big fight will be keeping your elbows in a tight bent position.
