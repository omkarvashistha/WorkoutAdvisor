desc - To complete a wall handstand push up:
1-Face a wall in a standing position.
2-Kick your feet up so you’re in a handstand position against a wall.
3-Squeeze your abs, glutes and thigh muscles.
4-Lower yourself toward the ground as far as possible.
5-Push back up and repeat.
Note: If you’re worried about falling on your head, put a yoga block or a pillow under your head. 
Also, if you find it too difficult/scary to kick your feet up against a wall, simply face opposite the wall and walk your feet up instead.
