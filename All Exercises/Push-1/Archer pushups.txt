desc - 1-Get into an all-fours position with your knees and toes flexed and in contact with the floor. Your hips should be over your knees. Position your hands wider than your shoulders. Your hands should be outwardly rotated so your fingers are pointed away from your body and a straight line is formed from your shoulders to your hands.
2-Grip the ground with your hands and rotate your shoulders outward to engage your lats. Straighten your legs to lift your knees off of the ground so you end up in a high plank position. Place your legs together or keep them hip-width apart.
3-Pre-tension your shoulders and hips with a good inhale and exhale while engaging your core. Squeeze your quads and glutes. Your chin should remain tucked throughout the movement, as if you were holding an egg under your chin. All repetitions should begin from this starting position.
4-Maintain a strong core position and shift your upper body toward your right side. Pull your right chest toward your right hand as you bend your right elbow. Allow your right shoulder and hand to inwardly rotate as you lower into the push-up position.
5-As you lower toward the right side, allow your left arm to straighten. Your left arm should be fully extended, forming a straight line from your shoulder to your hand. Your right elbow should finish close to your ribcage.
