1-Get into an all-fours position with your knees and toes flexed and in contact with the floor. Your hips should be over your knees, and your hands should be slightly wider than your shoulders.
2-Grip the ground with your hands and rotate your shoulders outward to engage your lats.
3-Straighten your legs to lift your knees off of the ground so you end up in a plank position. Your legs should be hip-width apart or slightly wider.
4-Pre-tension your shoulders and hips while engaging your core. Your ribs should be down and your pelvis should be slightly tucked.
5-Squeeze your quads and glutes. Your chin should remain tucked throughout the movement as if you were holding an egg under your chin.
6-Once in a strong position, have a partner gently place a weight plate on your lower to mid-back. The weight plate should be in a stable position before beginning the push-up.
7-While maintaining your alignment and a strong core, pull your chest toward your hands by bending your elbows. Your shoulder blades should retract as you lower toward the ground.
8-Lower your body until your upper arms are even with your back. Your elbows should be 45 degrees away from your body, and your wrists should be under your elbows.
9-Pause for a second at the bottom.
10-While maintaining your alignment, initiate the upward movement by squeezing your chest and straightening your elbows. Your shoulder blades should protract as you push to the top of the movement.
11-Finish the movement by squeezing your chest and triceps.
12-Repeat for your desired number of repetitions.
